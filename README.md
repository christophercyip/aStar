Implementation of A* pathfinding on an nxn grid with weighted nodes

Given a start node and an end node, this program will find the path between them such that the total cost of all nodes traversed in between is a minimum.  There are buttons to randomize all node costs, or both endpoints.  Clicking on an individual node will also increment the cost by 1 per click.  The path is recalculated on every click.

Size is configurable in the code, as well as the option to allow diagonal movements between nodes.

I guess one day a long while ago I thought Dijkstra's algorithm was overrated, hence this was made.
